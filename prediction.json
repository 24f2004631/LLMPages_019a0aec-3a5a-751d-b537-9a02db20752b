  "reason": "By December 2025, it is reasonable to expect that inflation will have moderated closer to the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. This moderation, coupled with a desire to avoid a deep recession, would likely prompt the Fed to begin a cycle of rate cuts from the current elevated levels. A rate of 4.00% (or 400 basis points) would represent a significant easing from current highs (e.g., 5.25-5.50%) but still keep rates above the pre-pandemic average, reflecting a slightly tighter stance than the historical 'lower for longer' era, ensuring continued vigilance against inflationary pressures while supporting economic growth."
